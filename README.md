### â—˜ Introduction
Despite Amazon often being regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands, it is important to mention that browsing the site can pose some challenges as it is quite confusing due to the lackluster layouts and inconsistent web page structure. Furthermore, the site can often be quite slow to browse due to extensive traffic. As a result, comparing multiple products can be a much more difficult process than it seems as it affects the user's decision-making as it requires browsing all the links for the same type of products with different specifications. Therefore, it is imperative to bypass the inconvenience a user might face otherwise, by automating the search procedure on the Amazon site, scraping relevant information, and displaying comprehensively in a tabular format making it easy for the user to compare and analyze for a better purchase decision on Amazon

The data extracted from the site consists of 4 columns: Product Name or Title Name, Prices, Product Descriptions, Ratings, Total Ratings, ASIN, and Product Links. Various examinations have been performed to analyze and explore the scraped raw data.
