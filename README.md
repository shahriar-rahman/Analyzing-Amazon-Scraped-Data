# Feature analysis of Amazon-Scraped Data 
===========================================================================
An Exploratory Data analysis of Amazon data which was scraped using Selenium Webdriver, an automation crawling tool for web-scraping.
This data analytic research is a follow-upfrom the project [Scraping Amazon Products based on a User Search](https://github.com/shahriar-rahman/Amazon-Product-Scraping)

### ◘ Introduction
Despite Amazon often being regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands, it is important to mention that browsing the site can pose some challenges as it is quite confusing due to the lackluster layouts and inconsistent web page structure. Furthermore, the site can often be quite slow to browse due to extensive traffic. As a result, comparing multiple products can be a much more difficult process than it seems as it affects the user's decision-making as it requires browsing all the links for the same type of products with different specifications. Therefore, it is imperative to bypass the inconvenience a user might face otherwise, by automating the search procedure on the Amazon site, scraping relevant information, and displaying comprehensively in a tabular format making it easy for the user to compare and analyze for a better purchase decision on Amazon

The data extracted from the site consists of 4 columns: Product Name or Title Name, Prices, Product Descriptions, Ratings, Total Ratings, ASIN, and Product Links. Various examinations have been performed to analyze and explore the scraped raw data.

### ◘ Objective
The primary incentive of this research is to:
* Process dataset by analyzing its integrity, missing values, duplicated values, and so forth.
* Perform various clean-ups, if required, and improve accessibility for more convenient exploratory analysis.
* Conduct exploratory analysis using a myriad of graphing tools to reach a conclusion.

</br></br>

### ◘ Approach
This research is classified into 2 steps:
1. Construct proper data
2. Analyse Missing Values
3. Inquire about Duplicate units, if any
4. Analyze Data using:
* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis
5. Save the processed data set.
